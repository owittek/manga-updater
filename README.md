# manga-updater
My first (working) attempt at a Manga Watcher. It uses Redis to store the latest Chapter & Deno as a TS Runtime.

The code quality is not up to my current standards as it was my first attempt at TS but it works for the purpose I built and I use it to this day. Currently working on a heavily upgraded version that includes a full rewrite of the code presented here.
